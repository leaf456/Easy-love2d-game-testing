# Easy-love2d-game-testing
Allows you to easily test your love2d game (or really any lua game) without having to update on every device.
# How to use:
1. on your device you want to test, run the /love transfer/client folder. These files won't need to be updated really ever.
2. on the computer you want to be the "server", run server.py (in /server).
3. in the /love transfer/files folder, put the files you want to be run on devices.
4. get the ip of the server. In windows: start>settings>network and internet>Wi-fi>[name of your wifi network]>scroll to bottom>ipv4 address
5. on the devices you installed the /love transfer/client folder in step 1, type the ip of the server in. On computers, use the keyboard. Otherwise, use the touchscreen and pad.
NOTE: YOU DO NOT HAVE TO TYPE THE PORT
6. press start. If it worked, status will be 200. Then click start again and the game will run!

I don't really care if you use it, copy it, modify it. I do know that I used a json library, however for the actual code that I wrote, you can do whatever you want with it.
